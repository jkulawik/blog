   <h4 class="subtitle">Reviewing every texting app I know of in terms of future-proofing and features</h4>
   <p>Come with me on the fruitless journey of trying to find a good Discord replacement.
Preferably free, open source and self-hostable.</p>
<p>Note: this post came out huge because I was being comprehensive, and there’s a lot of topics and apps to cover.
I covered pretty much every chat platform I have heard of, so bear with me :)</p>
<h3 id="the-rationale">The rationale</h3>
<p>The reasons for moving away from Discord are several.</p>
<ul>
 <li>
   <p><strong>Discord can do what it wants with our data</strong>.
In fact, it sells anonymised user data (most services do these days, but it doesn’t make it justifiable).
On a related note, Discord is not very fond of the right to be forgotten;
It doesn’t let you bulk delete your messages and refuses to delete them along with your account;
your message history remains and merely shows to be posted by a “deleted user”,
so any private information you put on there is still there and I find that creepy.</p>
 <li>
   <p><strong>Discord has existed for almost 10 years and will inevitably want to earn money</strong>
(or more of it; but I suspect that the company is not making a profit and runs on venture capital).
There’s something to be said by everyone on the Internet feeling entitled to free service,
but even if it is silly to expect it,
the truth is that increases in monetisation tend to be annoying,
regardless if it’s new paywalls or integrated ads (notably, on-stream ads are being tentatively tested right now).</p>
 <li>
   <p><strong>There have been talks of Discord getting sold off to Microsoft in the past</strong>.
Software getting bought by a large corporation is pretty much never good news;
Even if someone buys the app and decides not to kill it (like Microsoft loves to do),
acquisitions tend to end with enshittification when the new owners realize the software does not turn any profits.</p>
 <li>
   <p><strong>Paywalled features</strong>. At the moment the price of Nitro is alright,
but this wasn’t always the case; it has fluctuated a lot in the past.
In a similar vein, Discord decided to restrict certain features (e.g. announcement channels)
to community servers (i.e. making the server public and acquiring a large userbase).</p>
</ul>
<p>In short, my search for a Discord alternative stems from future-proofing,
data privacy paranoia and annoyance with emoji limitations.
There’s also the minor gripe of sound missing from screen sharing on Linux,
an issue which has been around for years and nothing is being done about it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/di0cqz/new_teamspeak_beta_with_free_voice_chat_text_chat/">This post on Reddit</a>
has a really cool comment that puts it well:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>That’s the main thing about Discord. <strong>For now</strong>, it’s mostly free (as in free beer, NOT free speech); and there hasn’t been big breaches, scandals or issues (as far as I know). But it’s a fully hosted solution, where we user and community handlers have <strong>zero control and guarantees</strong>.</p>
 <p>Tomorrow Discord can have advertisement, selling outrageous amount of telemetry, ask everyone to pay, or anything else. If you think that’s science-fiction, you’re too young to remember when Movable Type was the hot thing on the interweb and almost everyone used it “because it’s free”.</p>
 <p>That’s what Teamspeak and Mumble have. Control is in our hands. Even more so with Mumble, because it’s open source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, I do not plan on moving away from Discord yet;
but if shit hits the fan, I want to have an overview on what to replace it with.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-and-criteria">Challenges and criteria</h3>
<p>I mostly use Discord for interacting with casual communities,
which is the use-case I had in mind while evaluating the apps here.</p>
<p>The more I researched for this article, the more I realised how stupidly good Discord is on
many fronts; not only features, but how much it offers for free, how accessible it is,
and its availability on many platforms.
As such, finding an alternative comes with a set of challenges:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Feature parity</strong>.
Discord has a large set of features and usually <em>something</em> will be missing from the alternatives.
Some notable ones that I realized I took for granted:
   <ul>
     <li>Screen sharing
     <li>The reply feature (i.e. indicate which message you’re replying to)
     <li>Rich presence (i.e. embedding thumbnails and blurbs from links).
YouTube embeds well in most apps, but other stuff not as often (e.g. tweets).
   </ul>
 <li>
   <p><strong>Pricing</strong>.
My ideal candidate would be free and open-source, like Linux, Blender or GIMP.
While I won’t deny I’m a bit of a cheap bastard,
I also just don’t want to be left at the mercy of some executive chasing the bottom-line,
and you will see why in the section about Mattermost.</p>
 <li>
   <p><strong>Self-hosting and privacy vs accessibility</strong>.
Self-hosting puts you in control of your data (and notably also the data of the people who use your server),
but at the same time often comes with a high technical skill floor.
In fact the only beginner-friendly self-hosted app I found was TeamSpeak;
everything else will be out of reach for casual users.</p>
 <li>
   <p><strong>Appearance</strong>, or “feel” if you will.
Many apps look like phone messengers and have similarly simplistic features too;
basic interfaces with very spaced-out elements are not something I’m looking for.</p>
 <li>
   <p><strong>Self-hosting vs. interconnectivity</strong>.
Many apps are partially (TeamSpeak) or fully (Discord) centralized,
which lets you interact with any server, since they can communicate over the central service.
Most apps with self-hosting aren’t like this though; their servers are completely detached from other ones.
In fact, you should assume that
<strong>all self-hosted deployments cannot interact with other ones, unless noted otherwise</strong>.
This means that users will have to register separate accounts on each instance, which is annoying.
So it creates competition between your instance and bigger ones,
and at best your instance will attract a large number of users, which can be hard to sustain.
The feature of enabling interactions between decentralized servers is called federation;
it is pretty much the ideal (but rare) balance between data ownership and interconnectivity.
In short, I lean towards apps that are either federated or are semi-decentralized (like TeamSpeak).</p>
 <li>
   <p><strong>Open-source with a free plan is not free and open-source</strong>.
Business-oriented apps often label themselves as FOSS, but somehow also offer paid plans and can change the
free plan as they wish, making them a glorified version of a proprietary app.</p>
 <li>
   <p><strong>Mobile client apps</strong>. How good they are, and if there is one at all.
This is however the last thing I consider, as most apps fail other fundamental criteria.</p>
 <li><strong>Convincing other users to switch to the app</strong>.
I can make sacrifices in some regard, but convincing others to do so
would be making this task harder than it already is.
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="texting-apps">Texting apps</h2>
<p>Texting apps which are focused on direct messaging and group chats are a dime a dozen.
Many tech journalists out there act like these apps are good enough to replace Discord.
Well, they are not.</p>
<p>While not necessarily bad for what they are, texting apps aren’t in Discord’s ballpark.
They tend to cater to a normie userbase,
resulting in simplistic interfaces with a Fisher-price feel, basic features and limited customizability.
A few examples are WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Signal (A+ for privacy but it’s very simple).</p>
<p>Feature-wise they tend to be very similar:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: usually
 <li>Screen sharing: somewhat rare
 <li>Multichannel support: never
 <li>Custom emoji: no
 <li>Self-hosting: no
 <li>Pricing: free but your data is likely being harvested
</ul>
<h3 id="telegram">Telegram</h3>
<p><img src="https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/telegram/desktop/d89cd596919de725258e2feda770e650/screenshots/image-1_752x519@1.png" alt="(A screenshot of the Telegram desktop app)" /></p>
<p><a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> is an exception to some of the trends I laid out above.
It offers <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/android-themes">extensive customizability</a>,
recently started supporting multiple channels in group chats
and offers good privacy:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>All data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions. This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: yes
 <li>Screen sharing: yes
 <li>Multichannel support: yes, called “topics”, but these <a href="https://caribbean.dev/telegram-group-topics-the-pros-and-the-cons/">might interfere with a few other features</a>.
Note that this issue might be resolved already.
 <li>Custom emoji: yes
 <li>Self-hosting: no, but <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#q-can-i-run-telegram-using-my-own-server">not out of the question</a>
 <li>Pricing: free, with a few minor premium features which incentivize donations
 <li>Phone messenger design: yes
 <li>Other: supports message pinning
</ul>
<p>PS. Telegram has some crazy stuff going on behind the scenes.
It was made by Russians who are now moving the company around the world and the company itself
“has a complex corporate structure of shell companies to delay complying with government subpoenas”.</p>
<h3 id="skype">Skype</h3>
<p>Skype offers a weird hybrid of online chat and traditional phone features.
It is the app everyone ran from back in the day
and it seems to have stayed in that category.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: yes
 <li>Screen sharing: yes
 <li>Multichannel support: no
 <li>Custom emoji: no
 <li>Self-hosting: no
 <li>Pricing: free but it’s owned by Microsoft so your data is definitely being harvested
 <li>Phone messenger design: yes
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="business-oriented-apps">Business-oriented apps</h2>
<p>They tend to focus on integrating various development tools, log-in solutions
and other things related to corporate administration.</p>
<p>Since they’re meant for companies, they come with a big price tag and require self-hosting.
These apps are meant to be deployed by professional admins,
which means most of them will be too hard to install and operate for a regular user.</p>
<p>A weird phenomenon I’ve noticed as I researched these apps
was users complaining that the apps require premium plans for features
which to me seem free when reading their websites.
So take the feature lists with a grain of salt,
as it might turn out that something basic requires premium.</p>
<p>All of this places the business-oriented apps (I will call them BOAs for short)
as unlikely to be good Discord alternatives,
but I include them to cover all bases.
Quite interestingly, many user reviews tend to prefer Matrix (covered below) instead of these apps.</p>
<p>Note: Many of these apps integrate Jitsi instead of having their own video calls.
It’s a free and open-source video conference platform
which seems pretty good from my brief experience with it.
It has most of the features of Discord video calls (even the reaction soundboard)
and its servers can be self-hosted.</p>
<h3 id="mattermost">Mattermost</h3>
<p><img src="https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/mattermost/Desktop/0bf11798092500f8b581cb7431c8a187/screenshots/image-1_orig.png" alt="(A screenshot of Mattermost)" /></p>
<p>An app targeted to developers with a clean interface and a good feature set.
Mattermost would be a great alternative if not for its steep monetization of the premium version
without which you can only have 1-on-1 voice calls.
This change was introduced recently and is a good example of how company-owned software can pull the rug from under your feet.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: several integrations to choose from
 <li>Screen sharing: depends on integration
 <li>Multichannel support: yes
 <li>Custom emoji: yes
 <li>Self-hosting: yes
 <li>Pricing: there’s a free option which limits voice chat to 1-on-1 calls;
the next license is $10 per month <em>per user</em>, sadly making Mattermost quite hostile to hosting even small communities.
 <li>Phone messenger design: no
 <li>Other: has a mobile app, but I’ve heard that it has many issues.
</ul>
<h3 id="slack">Slack</h3>
<p>Widely used business app, but similarly to Mattermost it has a per-user payment plan.
The lack of self-hosting eliminates the main advantage of using a BOA;
if your data is gonna be hosted by a company, might as well just choose Guilded.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: yes
 <li>Screen sharing: yes
 <li>Multichannel support: yes
 <li>Custom emoji: yes
 <li>Self-hosting: no
 <li>Pricing: free version which limits voice chat to 1-on-1 calls and restricts you to a single “server” (workspace)
 <li>Phone messenger design: no
</ul>
<h3 id="rocket-chat">Rocket chat</h3>
<p>A pretty strong contender, but still has all the licensing trappings related to being business-oriented.
I’ve used it a bit and there’s something about the interface which doesn’t really do it for me.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/ynzakd/why_is_rocketchat_recommended/">Apparently</a>
there was a big push for monetization which made the app annoying (someone even called it “nagware”).</p>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: free Jitsi integration, other might require paid plans
 <li>Screen sharing: same as the above
 <li>Multichannel support: yes
 <li>Custom emoji: yes
 <li>Self-hosting: yes, federated; in fact, Rocket seems to use Matrix under the hood now.
 <li>Pricing: free version with a 25 user cap
 <li>Phone messenger design: no
 <li>Other: open-source, has a reportedly bad mobile app
</ul>
<h3 id="zulip">Zulip</h3>
<p><img src="https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/site_media/appmedia/2022/04/zulip-desktop-screenshot-dark.png" alt="(A screenshot of Zulip)" /></p>
<p><a href="https://zulip.com/">Zulip</a> uses a subscription-based channel approach;
an organization (server) has hashtagged “streams”, where you discuss separate topics.
Think of it as if you couldn’t talk in a Discord channel directly and had to always start threads instead;
I think this design atomizes discussions and ironically seems to cause misorganisation, according to some reviews.
Notably though, streams can be used like Discord’s categories instead, which should work pretty nicely.</p>
<p>The app also has a weird approach to draft messages (they disappear when you click away and appear in a separate drafts box).
Another issue is that I have posted in the wrong thread several times because I didn’t highlight the thread I thought I was in.</p>
<p>Looking at various user reviews, people tend to prefer Zulip over the other BOAs.
I’ve also seen its developers engage with the community, which is a great sign.
Despite the issues I noticed, Zulip seems pretty good;
If I was to pick one of the BOAs it would probably be this.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: integrates with Zoom or Jitsi
 <li>Screen sharing: same as the above
 <li>Multichannel support: threads-only, subscription based
 <li>Custom emoji: yes
 <li>Self-hosting: yes
 <li>Pricing: free version with pretty much all the features you need
 <li>Phone messenger design: no
 <li>Other: open-source, has a reportedly decent mobile app
</ul>
<h3 id="google-workspace">Google Workspace</h3>
<p>Google Workspace offers a good set of collaboration tools which integrate well between each other.
It is fully dedicated to business though and has no free option.
Google Chat (a part of Workspace) can be used separately, but it only offers group chats.</p>
<h3 id="microsoft-teams">Microsoft Teams</h3>
<p>Soyware with annoying hiccups every few moments,
which in classic Microsoft fashion has an unintuitive interface with features hidden in obscure places.
The video chat is solid, but asides from that do yourself a favor and don’t bother with this thing.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="matrix">Matrix</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> is an open communication protocol,
designed for decentralized and federated communication.</p>
<p>An account can be registered on any server (which becomes your “homeserver”)
and it can interact with any other Matrix server.
Kind of like with email where you can register anywhere and still talk to others.</p>
<p>Matrix clients differ mostly with these features:</p>
<ul>
 <li>End-to-end encryption
 <li>Spaces.
Matrix was originally designed only with group chats (“rooms”) in mind.
The Spaces feature was retrofitted in 2021 to group rooms in something similar to Discord’s servers.
This feature is sometimes not implemented in clients as a result.
 <li>Voice/video calls and whether these can be done in groups or 1-on-1 only.
Matrix has a somewhat experimental native call feature,
but many apps simply integrate Jitsi.
 <li>Custom emojis (also called stickers here) are
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2024/03/22/matrix-v1.10-release/">not really in the Matrix spec yet</a>,
but some clients implement them already.
 <li>Phone messenger design: unfortunately most clients have a messenger feel.
Probably a result of the underlying protocol focusing on that style of messaging.
</ul>
<p>Note that registering on a free matrix instance gets you back into the good old “not owning your data” situation.
<a href="https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/list-of-matrix-servers.html">Apparently some hosters can be heavy-handed with moderating</a> - admins can delete your chat rooms and accounts without prior notice.
Considering that the website above links to a few servers with questionable content,
I take what they call “absurdly strict moderation” with a grain of salt,
but it regardless goes to show that you should pick free servers carefully.</p>
<p>You might also hear that Matrix leaks metadata and whatnot,
but these claims <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivacyGuides/comments/q7qsty/is_matrix_still_a_metadata_disaster/">are probably exagerrated</a>.
As far as I can see from <a href="https://www.matrix.org/~matthew/Response_to_-_Notes_on_privacy_and_data_collection_of_Matrix.pdf">a document addressing those concerns</a>,
only the necessary data is shared between Matrix servers,
and things like e-mails and phone numbers are only shared if you decide to add them to your profile.
The document is from 2019, so these aspects of the protocol might have been improved further.</p>
<p>Last thing of note is that Matrix has several server implementations.
The main one, Synapse, uses a lot of system resources to run.
I’ve also had issues with deploying it on Docker, it’s less than straightforward.
Another notable implementation is Dendrite, which should be more lightweight.
I’m not sure if it’s easier to deploy though.</p>
<h3 id="element">Element</h3>
<p><img src="https://element.io/images/Ui-grad-homepage.png" alt="(A screenshot of Element)" /></p>
<p><a href="https://element.io/">Element</a> (previously Riot) is the most mature Matrix client app.
This doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the best one though; I’ve heard it’s fairly bloated.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: yes, <a href="https://element.io/blog/introducing-native-matrix-voip-with-element-call/">native</a>,
but I’ve seen <a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny/issues/528#issuecomment-1872593452">developers say</a>
that the current conferencing implementation is a messy prototype
 <li>Screen sharing: yes
 <li>Multichannel support: kinda
 <li>Custom emoji: no
 <li>Self-hosting: yes
 <li>Pricing: free version with up to 200 users and a few limitations
(specifics are hard to determine because of the jargon they use)
 <li>Phone messenger design: yes
 <li>Other:
   <ul>
     <li>Federated and decentralised; you have good control over your data
     <li>Seems to have some nice features that aren’t listed directly on websites
     <li>Has a decent mobile version
     <li>Supports bots (called “integrations” in Matrix) and offers several ones already
   </ul>
</ul>
<h3 id="cinny">Cinny</h3>
<p><img src="https://cinny.in/assets/preview-dark.png" alt="(A screenshot of Cinny)" /></p>
<p><a href="https://cinny.in/">Cinny</a> is a Matrix client with a more Discord-like interface which supports custom emojis using the yet-unimplemented <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2545">spec proposal</a>. Not sure if those will work with other instances.
It also supports Spaces, but no voice/video calls (<a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny/issues/528">for the foreseeable future</a>).</p>
<p>From what I gather this is a web client, so I’m not sure if/how well it works on mobile.
I could not find any screenshots of the mobile layout.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: no, but maybe someday
 <li>Screen sharing: no
 <li>Multichannel support: kinda
 <li>Custom emoji: yes
 <li>Self-hosting: yes
 <li>Pricing: free
 <li>Phone messenger design: no
 <li>Other: open-source
</ul>
<h3 id="fluffychat">FluffyChat</h3>
<p><img src="https://freshbrewed.science/content/images/2024/01/cinny-07.png" alt="(A screenshot of FluffyChat)" /></p>
<p>FluffyChat is a client which supports both custom emojis and video calls,
and has clients for every major platform.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: yes (I think it’s Jitsi?)
 <li>Screen sharing: yes
 <li>Multichannel support: kinda
 <li>Custom emoji: yes
 <li>Self-hosting: yes
 <li>Pricing: free
 <li>Phone messenger design: yes
 <li>Other: open-source
</ul>
<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<p>A list of other Matrix clients can be seen <a href="https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/">here</a>.
I will not be going over all of them, as I did not find any other interesting ones.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="xmpp">XMPP</h2>
<p>XMPP is an open and federated text message protocol, similar in concept to Matrix.
It’s often used for temporary messages (e.g. text chat in Jitsi calls) and push notifications.
Notably, WhatsApp is a proprietary system based on XMPP.</p>
<p>While the core of the protocol is solid,
extended functionalities (XEPs - XMPP extension protocols) are a mess.
They are very atomized and most of them are stuck in the “experimental” stage.
As a result, there’s a lot of feature disparity between clients
(e.g. setting a profile pic worked fine between Movim and Gajim for me, but Converse.js did not register it),
and no clients support all major platforms
(except AstraChat, but it’s a company-owned phone messenger)
so a web client might be the best option.
If I understand correctly, there is a XEP for group voice calls,
but none for custom emojis.</p>
<p>XMPP has no concept for “servers” (in the Discord sense): each chat room operates separately.
So similarly to Matrix, “servers” would have to be awkwardly retrofitted into the protocol.</p>
<p>XMPP is <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/matrix-vs-xmpp/">more lightweight and secure</a>
than Matrix, so if you only need regular group chats, it is a great option.
As far as I can tell there is no XMPP client which comes close to Discord,
nor do I have hope of there ever being one;
XMPP is pretty nieche (I saw even less discussion about it than with Matrix)
and the protocol makes it hard.</p>
<p>Here’s two of the clients I tested.
I also briefly tested Converse.js and I don’t get why it has the reputation of the most mature client,
because it seems to have less features and interoperability than the other two I tried.
I also wanted to try Monocle, but it’s just an instance of Movim.</p>
<h3 id="movim">Movim</h3>
<p>Movim is a web client for XMPP which can be self-hosted.
It’s pretty decent overall and it’s a shame it doesn’t support custom emojis or group calls,
because it would be very solid otherwise.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: only 1-on-1. Group calls <a href="https://github.com/movim/movim/issues/1110">are considered, but the developers need someone to sponsor it</a>.
 <li>Screen sharing: yes
 <li>Multichannel support: no
 <li>Custom emoji: no. There are stickers, but these are configured per-instance of the Movim client app server,
which is very restrictive. Stickers can’t be used inline anyway.
 <li>Self-hosting: yes (both the web app itself and XMPP servers)
 <li>Pricing: free
 <li>Phone messenger design: no
 <li>Other: has support for public blog posts ala Telegram
</ul>
<h3 id="gajim">Gajim</h3>
<p>Gajim is a Windows/Linux client for XMPP
which ads chatroom “workspaces” in its UI which resemble how Discord works, but the rooms are still separate.
It has a custom emoji plugin, but I couldn’t get any plugins to work.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: no? Maybe plugin
 <li>Screen sharing: no?
 <li>Multichannel support: simulated
 <li>Custom emoji: supposedly

<p>These are more likely to replace Discord than business apps,
but tend to be different enough that they won’t be a perfect fit.</p>
<h3 id="teamspeak">TeamSpeak</h3>
<p><img src="https://discourse-forums-images.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/d/bde87328b5d5cfe3a1ef611aeef0d375710a2b23.png" alt="(A screenshot of TeamSpeak)" /></p>
<p>While great for voice chat and featuring some nice customization,
<a href="https://teamspeak.com/en/">TeamSpeak</a> has an unfortunate approach to text chats.</p>
<p>Servers only have voice channels.
These have an attached text chat, which is accessible only if you’re in the voice call.
It is intended for sharing links and files during calls, and designed with privacy in mind;
people who aren’t in the voice call can’t read it, and chat history gets deleted after the call.</p>
<p>Group text chats were recently added, but these are separate from servers and single-channeled.</p>
<p>TeamSpeak sadly won’t be a contender for Discord until it adds regular text channels to servers.
Despite TeamSpeak memeing on Twitter about being an underdog to Discord,
I unfortunately see no desire from their team to implement this feature.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: yes (great one, reportedly)
 <li>Screen sharing: in the works for over a year, but no ETA or significant news about it.
 <li>Multichannel support: not really; tied to voice calls and temporary
 <li>Custom emoji: yes
 <li>Self-hosting: yes, and unlike everywhere else it is very simple
 <li>Pricing: free version permits owning a single server with 32 users
 <li>Phone messenger design: no
 <li>Other:
   <ul>
     <li>Limited text chat functionality but has a simple reply feature and a message pin feature
     <li>Has been around for ages, so while still a proprietary app, it is pretty trustworthy
     <li>The app interface can be a bit confusing at times, even in version 5
   </ul>
</ul>
<h3 id="steam-chat">Steam chat</h3>
<p><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fs.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fedce1225506731ed1963fda18a6294bc%2F206551184%2Fsgteamchat.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=4609225a19614ef2ebb109e121bb4ca15513f814454b55934653714211d52338&amp;ipo=images" alt="(A screenshot of a Steam group chat)" /></p>
<p>Bet you didn’t expect this one, huh?
Steam’s group chat feature offers a server-like experience now.
It’s remarkably similar to Discord in the way it works, but much simpler.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: yes
 <li>Screen sharing: no
 <li>Multichannel support: yes
 <li>Custom emoji: not really; they are limited to what’s available in the Steam Points store
 <li>Self-hosting: no
 <li>Pricing: free
 <li>Phone messenger design: no
 <li>Other: messages cannot be edited
</ul>
<h3 id="mumble">Mumble</h3>
<p>Mumble is a voice chat app similar to TeamSpeak,
but it seems to have even less text chat capabilities;
in fact as far as I can tell, it doesn’t have one at all.
It is a free open-source alternative to TeamSpeak though, if you want one.</p>
<h3 id="irc">IRC</h3>
<p>IRC is a classic but only uses plain text (no emojis, reactions etc.)
and as a text chat protocol, has no voice chat by definition.
Chat history is not saved, so if you’re not online when a conversation happens,
you will not see it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="discord-clones">Discord clones</h2>
<p>These might seem like the obvious pick at first,
but can have the same privacy and future-proofing issues as Discord.</p>
<h3 id="guilded">Guilded</h3>
<p><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic1.srcdn.com%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F05%2Fguildedlogo.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=eb8da7a0e2f464fb6c20277c33297e30ae45795b71dee7c5581d9d03a80f0800&amp;ipo=images" alt="(A screenshot of Guilded)" /></p>
<p>Guilded offers a ton of useful features, posing it as a good candidate for being a “Discord killer”.
However, there are two issues:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Guilded is owned by Roblox,
a company which earns money from borderline-free labor
(Roblox takes a lion’s share) done by usually underage game developers
 <li>The app is ran in the same freeware/venture capital way as Discord
</ul>
<p>These two factors don’t make me very optimistic for Guilded’s long-term viability.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I fully understand Guilded’s business model,
but there seems to be no paywalled features;
instead, users can buy subscriptions for servers,
which grants them roles and other per-server benefits (e.g. channel access)
which are configurable by the server owner.
Guilded earns money by taking a fee from those subs.
You can also buy a subscription (Guilded Gold) to fund development
and get access to beta features early.</p>
<p>Moving onto the app itself though;
Guilded works a bit differently than most of the apps listed here.
What Discord calls servers are called groups in Guilded,
and Guilded servers can have multiple groups:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Server 1
├── Group 1
│   └── (chats)
└── Group 2
    └── (chats)
Server 2
├── Group 3
│   └── (chats)
└── Group 4
    └── (chats)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It’s like another layer of organisation above Discord’s servers.
To avoid confusion, I will be using Guilded’s terminology for the rest of this segment.</p>
<p>Also worth nothing is that similarly to Discord,
<a href="https://support.guilded.gg/hc/en-us/articles/360039235054-Privacy">Guilded sells anonymised user data</a>.</p>
<p>The features I mentioned above include:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Pretty fun customization (e.g. using gradients in roles intead of plain colors)
 <li>Advanced channel types:
   <ul>
     <li>Streaming (video calls with screen sharing)
     <li>Voice channels; these are further organised into rooms,
for an overall feel similar to TeamSpeak
     <li>Calendar channels for events
     <li>Scheduling channels (users can mark their availability over time)
     <li>Announcement channels
     <li>Forums
     <li>To-do lists
     <li>Docs (wiki-like stuff)
     <li>Media (this works kinda like social media, where people can comment and react on the media you post)
   </ul>
 <li>Configurable bots; while there’s no public API for programmers at the moment,
Guilded allows you to create bots from the GUI using a set of triggers and actions the bot can take in response.
</ul>
<p>Overview:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: yes
 <li>Screen sharing: yes
 <li>Multichannel support: yes
 <li>Custom emoji: yes, unlimited per server.
I’m not sure these can be used across servers,
but can probably be used across groups in a server.
 <li>Self-hosting: no
 <li>Pricing: free
 <li>Phone messenger design: no
 <li>Other: has a decent phone app
</ul>
<h3 id="revolt-chat">Revolt chat</h3>
<p><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdl.flathub.org%2Frepo%2Fscreenshots%2Fchat.revolt.RevoltDesktop-stable%2F1504x846%2Fchat.revolt.RevoltDesktop-e70e44718034af84ddbd1f89375bb4cd.png&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=6ae14e269eb92b8ee6b1e67e16f3a52e0175bb7dc49cdb4978b31eb3eb2d00a1&amp;ipo=images" alt="(A screenshot of Revolt)" /></p>
<p>On the surface, <a href="https://revolt.chat/">Revolt</a> is a drop-in replacement for Discord that’s open source and abides by GPDR!
There is more to it than meets the eye though.</p>
<p>I saw some rather concerning comments about the developer team, drama,
whether the app is really open source and about the self-hosting under <a href="https://itsfoss.com/revolt/">this article</a>.
I take them with a grain of salt, as they seem to come from disgruntled users,
but they did lead me to some other interesting info.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://developers.revolt.chat/faq/federation">FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>The Revolt team currently consists mostly of students (18-20 years old),
and the majority of the project organisation and work is being done by one person (Insert).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering the developers’ ages, this app is an impressive achievement,
but at the same time the bulk of development being done by one person leaves me wondering about the longevity of the project.
Glancing at the r/revoltchat subreddit also reveals that the app still has a lot of technical issues.</p>
<p>While not an issue in itself, an annoyance that I had was the lack of a feature list on the Revolt website,
or in the developer docs.
There’s also no information about self-hosting on their website,
although after some <del>Googling</del> DuckDuckGoing (?) it can be found as <a href="https://github.com/revoltchat/self-hosted">a Docker deployment</a>.</p>
<p>There’s some massively good news on other fronts though:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>We have a variety of monetisation ideas lined up internally, with these, it is not my intention for us to paywall features and I find it unlikely we would ever do that considering it would contradict what we’re trying to achieve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in their privacy policy:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>We will NEVER sell your data to any third-parties.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: yes, but unfinished
 <li>Screen sharing: couldn’t find any mentions of it, and definitely not even on the horizon considering the above
 <li>Multichannel support: yes
 <li>Custom emoji: yes
 <li>Self-hosting: yes
 <li>Pricing: fully free and intending to remain that way
 <li>Phone messenger design: no
 <li>Other: End-to-end encryption, message pinning not implemented yet; entire GUI is customizable
</ul>
<p>I really hope this project succeeds and learning about it made me appreciate the insane amount of work that goes into making such an app;
however, I’m not entirely sure how usable it is at the moment.</p>
<h3 id="spacebar-chat">Spacebar chat</h3>
<p>Previously known as Fosscord,
<a href="https://spacebar.chat/">Spacebar</a> is a free and open source Discord clone that’s compatible with existing Discord bots.</p>
<p>It is still early in development and not really in a usable state,
but is posing up to be an interesting option.
In fact it’s so early in development that I could not find a screnshot of the app,
although the website offers a login form.
My first impression of it was better than of Revolt,
as it’s very transparent about what it is and isn’t.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Voice chat: eventually
 <li>Screen sharing: not for the foreseeable future
 <li>Multichannel support: yes
 <li>Custom emoji: yes
 <li>Self-hosting: yes
 <li>Pricing: fully free and intending to remain that way
 <li>Phone messenger design: no idea
 <li>Other: the app aims to be fully compatible with Discord APIs
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>First, honorable mentions:</p>
<p><strong>Steam chat</strong> is my current backup for contact with online friends,
but due to its simplicity it will likely stay just a back-up.
(Sidenote: it’s pretty funny how Steam tries to make itself a social platform but its userbase keeps being immune to it)</p>
<p><strong>Guilded</strong> - feature-wise it fits like a glove and even surpasses Discord,
but when it comes to my other goals it is not looking good;
It’s not future-proof and has mediocre privacy (reminder that Guilded sells your data).
With its accessibility and features, it is the most likely
app to be adapted by regular users (non-techies).
If you are looking for an alternative and things like privacy and self-hosting
are not of interest to you, Guilded kills the competition on all fronts.</p>
<p>Carrying on;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/t204t4/for_those_suggesting_guilded_revolt_signal_or/">this great post</a>
on Reddit points out, the fundamental issue with apps like Revolt, Guilded and so on
is that they are not based on an open protocol;
the moment they do something unpopular, you’re looking for an alternative once again.</p>
<p>In light of that, the idealist in me says that Matrix is the future.
However, the way it’s designed (namely, group chats being first citizens)
is kind of questionable to me.
My attempts at deploying a server did not give me a good first impression about the self-hosting,
and joining an existing instance can be risky as I’ve mentioned before.
I guess I could try another server implementation.
Another issue is the client selection and what features they offer.
I was almost ready to write Matrix off because I could not find a client
which supported both custom emoji and voice calls.
Thankfully there’s FluffyChat, although I’m not a fan of its phone messenger layout;
I prefer how Cinny looks, but it has no voice calls and no mobile app.</p>
<p>XMPP has similar upsides and downsides as Matrix,
but it’s obscure and messy.
The client selection is not great either,
with none of them supporting both calls and custom emojis.</p>
<p>Asides from Matrix and XMPP, <strong>TeamSpeak</strong> is the only app that’s both self-hostable and allows instances to interact.
It is also the only app with a hassle-free server deployment.
For those reasons, I <em>really</em> want to use it;
The pretty nice “feel” and the app’s longevity make me pretty partial to it.
However, the lack of proper text channels beyond group chats is something I cannot gloss over.
For now, I can only cross my thumbs that the TS devs will implement those someday.</p>
<p><strong>Revolt</strong> - while it offers self-hosting (non-federated, sadly),
the data policies and monetization plans make using their centralized service very acceptable.
At the same time, these things are not set in stone, so Matrix still has an upper hand here.
Regardless, the app is not very mature yet and the lack of voice calls is a major drawback
(not sure why they haven’t just integrated Jitsi).
I will definitely be watching Revolt’s development though, as it has big potential,
and I would be willing to use it in the future.</p>
<p>This leaves us with… <strong>Zulip</strong>?
As things are, it has remarkably few drawbacks;
I’d be willing to give it a shot, but the corporate feel (e.g. server = organization) is kinda meh.
Definitely the least greedy BOA… although you can never know how long this will last.</p>
<p>So… what’s the verdict? I don’t think I can decisively make one,
not while every good alternative has some glaring flaw.</p>
<p>FluffyChat was a last minute find that saves this blog post from having no clear answer;
it is pretty much the best future-proof and sovereign alternative to Discord I found.
Unfortunately I say that a bit begrudgingly, because its phone messenger feel puts me off.</p>
<p>For those reasons I will be watching for any developments with Cinny, TeamSpeak and Revolt.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, I will probably try deploying a Matrix server again and getting some hands-on
experience with FluffyChat; we’ll see how that goes.</p>
