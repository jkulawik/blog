My blog built using Jekyll and the [jekyllBear](https://github.com/knhash/jekyllBear) theme.

## An easy to use, minimal, text focused Jekyll theme

[Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/) is *"a blogging platform where words matter most"*. 

This is a port of it's theme to Jekyll, with some tweaks. So you can use GitHub Pages to host your blog while getting the same awesome Bear Blog feels.

**Stop worrying about the style, focus on your writing.**

- Tiny, optimized, and awesome pages, with [a 100 on PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fknhash.in%2FjekyllBear%2F)
- No trackers, ads, or scripts, *did I mention minimal already?*
- Auto light and dark themes
- Tag support, to filter blog pages
- Quick, *15 minute* setup
- Gallery view for your images
- Code highlighting

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.
