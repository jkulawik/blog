## {{site.description}}

I'm some guy on the Internet.

I write about programming and software in general, as well as online privacy and video games.
I also enjoy movies and books, so a review might show up here every now and then.

My background is in ICT (information and communications technology) and cybersecurity.
Currently working in backend development,
but I also have a fair bit of experience with developing games.
I have made [a bunch of Amnesia mods](https://www.moddb.com/members/vuko-drakkeinen/mods)
as a teenager, which hooked me on programming and now we're here.

I've tried making 3D video games in Godot, but unfortunately I haven't finished
either of them; it turns out that making games from scratch is a ton of work,
over half of which consists of making art assets (something I'm an amateur in).

This blog is based on the [jekyllBear]([repository](https://github.com/knhash/jekyllBear)) theme for Jekyll.
