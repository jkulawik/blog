Come with me on the fruitless journey of trying to find a free and open Discord alternative, preferably with the option of Self-hosting.

The rationale for this is as follows:
* Discord can do what it wants with our data,
and it already shows its mindset by not letting you bulk delete your messages
while it refuses to delete them along with your account
(deleting your account only anonymizes your account, while its message history remains)
* Discord has existed for almost 10 years and will be ramping up its monetization schemes sooner rather than later.
Just recently it was announced that the app would start integrating ads, although this has been fairly limited so far.
* Honestly I don't want to pay a decent chunk of money to be able to use custom emojis anywhere I want,
or in order to raise their limit per server.

Challenges:
* Convincing other users to start using something else, but that's a whole other can of worms.
* Discord has a large feature set and quite often *something* will be missing from the alternatives.
Some notable ones that I realized I took for granted:
  * Screen sharing
  * The reply feature (i.e. indicate which message you're replying to)
  * Rich presence; I mostly post YouTube and Twitter links, YouTube often embeds well, but other stuff not so often.
* How good the mobile versions of the apps are, if there is one at all
* Many of the open apps share a different approach to channel organisation where you
have to subscribe to specific channels rather than seeing them all by default.
While in itself this can be a benefit (pick what you want instead of muting everyhing you don't),\
it can diminish the sense of community by putting users into bubbles.
Additionally, it is sometimes implemented in a way that mixes channels of different servers in one list,
making for a messy experience.

## Texting apps

Texting apps which are focused on direct messaging and group chats are a dime a dozen.

These won't replace Discord, but are worth mentioning to establish what I'm going for,
as many "Discord alternative" articles on the net tend to act like these are even remotely suitable.

While not necessarily bad for what they are, texting apps aren't in Discord's ballpark.
They tend to be mobile-first apps too, which usually makes for a clunky desktop experience.
* WhatsApp, Messenger and so on
* Signal (A+ for privacy though)

Feature-wise they tend to be very similar:
* Voice chat: sometimes
* Screen sharing: usually implemented along with voice
* Multichannel support: never
* Custom emoji: no
* Self-hosting: no
* Pricing: free but your data is likely being harvested

### Telegram

Telegram offers extensive customizability, but it is a mobile app first,
so in some ways it tends to be simplistic.
Other than that it seems like a good candidate.

* Voice chat: yes
* Screen sharing: yes
* Multichannel support: yes, called "topics", but these [might interfere with some other features](https://caribbean.dev/telegram-group-topics-the-pros-and-the-cons/)
* Custom emoji: yes
* Self-hosting: no
* Pricing: free, with some premium features
* Other: somewhat privacy-friendly

## Business-oriented apps

Most of these are fairly decent overall, but lack in customization.
Additionally, they tend to be pricey and do not offer no-self-hosting registration,
placing them as unlikely to be a good Discord alternative.

### Slack

### Rocket chat

### Mattermost

### Zulip

Zulip is a pretty good app for businesses,
but the lack of built-in voice/video calls is a shame.

Instead of servers, there are organizations,
so owning multiple servers does not sound very plausible.
Zulip uses a subscription-based channel approach;
an organization has hashtagged "streams", where you discuss separate topics.
Think of it as if you couldn't talk in a Discord channel directly and had to always start threads instead.
It's not the worst approach for a business, but pretty bad for a community.

* Voice chat: not native; integrated with Zoom or Jitsi
* Screen sharing: same as the above
* Multichannel support: threads-only, subscription based
* Custom emoji: yes
* Self-hosting: yes
* Pricing: free version with pretty much all the features you need
* Other: open source

### Microsoft Teams

Teams is crapware dedicated for business that has annoying hick-ups every few moments,
and in classic Microsoft fashion has an unintuitive interface with features hidden in obscure places.
The voice/video chat is pretty nice, but asides from that do yourself a favor and don't bother with this thing.

## General and gaming-oriented apps

These are more likely to replace Discord than business apps,
but tend to be different enough that they aren't won't be a perfect fit.

### TeamSpeak

While great for voice chat and featuring some nice customization,
TeamSpeak has a... specific approach to text chats.

Servers only have voice channels.
These have an attached text chat, which is accessible only if you're in the voice call.
This is mostly for the purpose of sharing links and files during calls,
but it's intended as private and chat history gets deleted after the call.

Group text chats were recently added, but as with mobile apps, these are single-channeled.
The app interface can be a bit confusing at times, even in version 5.

TeamSpeak is great if you mostly use Discord for voice calls,
but it is not a contender until it adds regular text channels to servers.
Sadly, despite TeamSpeak memeing about being an underdog to Discord on Twitter,
they seem to move backwards on this issue;
a singular global text chat for servers [was apparently removed in TeamSpeak 5](https://community.teamspeak.com/t/global-server-chat/2458/12).

* Voice chat: yes (great one, reportedly)
* Screen sharing: in the works for over a year, but no ETA or significant news about it.
* Multichannel support: not really (voice only)
* Custom emoji: yes
* Self-hosting: yes
* Pricing: free version which permits owning a single server with 32 users
* Other: quite limited text chat functionality, has a simple reply feature

### Steam chat

Now that's a doozy, innit?
Yes, Steam's group chat feature offers a server-like experience now.
It's remarkably similar to Discord in the way it works, but much simpler.

* Voice chat: yes
* Screen sharing: no
* Multichannel support: yes
* Custom emoji: sort-of; need to be bought with Steam Points (which are granted along any game purchase) and are limited to what's available in the store
* Self-hosting: no
* Pricing: free
* Other: messages cannot be edited

### Element

### Skype

### Mumble

### IRC

IRC is a classic but only uses plain text (no emojis, reactions etc.)
and as a text chat protocol, has no voice chat by definition.

## Discord clones

These might seem like the best pick at first,
but the issue is that you don't get control over your data.
These share Discord's approach of "its free but 


### Guilded

### Revolt chat
