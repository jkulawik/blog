Come with me on the fruitless journey of trying to find a free and open Discord alternative, preferably with the option of self-deployment.

The rationale for this is as follows:
* Discord can do what it wants with our data,
and it already shows its approach by not letting you bulk delete your messages
while it refuses to delete them along with your account
(deleting your account only anonymizes your account, while its message history remains)
* Discord has existed for almost 10 years and will be ramping up its monetization schemes sooner rather than later.
Just recently it was announced that the app would start integrating ads, although this has been fairly limited so far.
* Honestly I don't want to pay a decent chunk of money to be able to use custom emojis anywhere I want,
or in order to raise their limit per server.

Challenges:
* Convincing other users to start using something else. The classic conundrum.
* Discord's voice chat and video streaming are impressively stable and fast,
not to mention that screen sharing is pretty rare already outside of dedicated video-conference software
* Discord has a large feature set and quite often *something* will be missing from the alternatives.
Some notable ones that I realized I took for granted:
  * The reply feature (i.e. indicate which message you're replying to)
  * Rich presence; I mostly post YouTube and Twitter links, YouTube often embeds well, but other stuff not so often.
* How good the mobile versions of the apps are
(unfortunately even if the desktop app is good, this is not a given),
if there is one at all
* Discord is free except for mostly superficial features;
a stark contrast to many apps which require large payments to use at all
* Many of the open apps share a different approach to channel organisation where you
subscribe to specific channels rather than see them all out of the box.
This is sometimes implemented in a way that mixes channels of different servers,
making for a messy experience.

## (Dis)honorable mentions

Texting apps which are direct messaging only or at best offer a group chat are a dime a dozen.
While not necessarily bad for what they are, they aren't exactly in Discord's ballpark.
These tend to be mobile-first apps too, which is (again) a different league.
* WhatsApp, Messenger and so on
* Signal (A+ for privacy though)
* Telegram (customizability seems nice)

IRC is a classic but only uses plain text and as a text chat protocol, has no voice chat by definition.

## General and gaming-oriented apps

The most likely candidates.

### TeamSpeak

While great for voice chat and featuring some nice customization,
TeamSpeak's text chat is an vestigial.
Servers only have voice channels with an attached text chat accessible only if you're in the voice call.
This is mostly for the purpose of sharing links etc. during calls.

Group chats were recently added, but as with mobile apps, these are single-channeled.
You could hack multi-channel with them by create multiple group chats with prefixes in the name,
but their management is separate which makes this unviable.

The interface itself can be a bit confusing at times too, even in version 5.
A screen sharing feature is in the works, but with no ETA.

TeamSpeak is great if you mostly use Discord for voice calls,
but it is not a contender until it adds regular text channels to servers.

Sadly, despite them memeing about being an underdog to Discord on Twitter,
they seem to move backwards on this issue;
a singular global text chat for servers [was apparently removed in TeamSpeak 5](https://community.teamspeak.com/t/global-server-chat/2458/12).

* Voice chat: yes (great one, reportedly)
* Screen sharing: not yet
* Text chats: yes, but limited
* Multichannel support: not really
* Custom emoji: yes
* Self-deployment: yes
* Pricing: free version which permits owning 1 server with 32 users
* Other: has a simple reply feature

### Steam chat

Now that's a doozy, innit?
Yes, Steam's group chat feature offers a server-like experience.
It's remarkably similar to Discord in the way it works, but much simpler.



### Revolt chat

### Zulip

## Business-oriented apps

Most of these are fairly decent overall, but lack in customization.
Additionally, they tend not to be free

### Rocket chat

### Slack
