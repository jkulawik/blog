I decided to dive deeper into XMPP etc etc

Converse.js: very plain
Monocle: movim instance

## Movim

Movim is a web client for XMPP which can be self-hosted.

* Voice chat: only 1-on-1. Group calls [are considered, but the developers need someone to sponsor it](https://github.com/movim/movim/issues/1110).
* Screen sharing: yes
* Multichannel support: no (or at least I did not find any clear way of doing that)
* Custom emoji: no. There are stickers, but these are configured per-instance of the Movim client app server
* Self-hosting: yes (both the web app itself and XMPP servers)
* Pricing: free
* Phone messenger design: no
* Other: has support for public blog posts ala Telegram
