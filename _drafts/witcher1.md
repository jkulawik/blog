plot is really good
dialogues are good, most of the time
some mischaracterization (zoltan vs yarpen, trissefer)
the game features many small stories and mentions of stuff from the books;
it's a victory lap but also feels a bit silly for all of this to be happen in one game

the choices between order vs elves are just painful;
the neutral option ends up being "everyone hates you" option;
while this structure follows "Lesser Evil",
the fact that making these choices locks you into only siding with one faction is quite annoying


## Things that didn't age well

some haphazard dialogues (trying to be very serious/philosophical out of the blue)

collecting sex cards is kinda funny and outlandish,
especially considering that Geralt can bang like 30 women in this game

## Things that weren't great in the first place

game balance (hard mode is barely different to normal and still feels easy)

alvin and all his contrivances

forced love plot (Triss/Shani) with forced attempts at family

everyone's insistence on not mentioning Yennefer and Ciri is bizarre


## Chapter reviews

Prologue - pretty nice but the combat is boring
1 is nice but its ending is a bit haphazard and locks you in for a long time and without warning
2 and 3 very big but quite interesting
4 is nice at first but gets pretty boring because of the big open spaces you need to go back and forth across
