I am bothered by my inclination towards negative points in my writing.
I also see similar issues pop up in other people's reviews.
As I don't see myself doing forced positivity, I wanted to give context to my style of writing,
as well as ruminate about issues with game critique at large.

### Personal inclinations

I'm an engineer. I have been trained to notice flaws, address them and seek improvements.
As a result, I naturally gravitate towards findings issues in the things I enjoy,
rather than formulating compliments.

### More to say about flawed games

As a result of the above, I usually have the most to say about games which
I found to be amazing, but flawed.
These reviews come out sounding highly critical despite me really enjoying the game in question.

A great example of this is comparing Amnesia: Rebirth and Amnesia: The Bunker.
Bunker was pretty damn good; but after the initial hype died down,
I find myself and my friends rarely mentioning it (
although that's partially that game's fault - there's not that much to discover in it,
and the gameplay is much shallower than advertised).
Meanwhile mentioning the severely flawed Rebirth is almost guaranteed to spawn
discussion about what exactly causes it to be not-that-good,
a topic so elusive that we still haven't found an answer. But we keep trying.

### Reviewing games like movies

I love solid gameplay, but as long as I have a bunch of tasks to keep me occupied,
I likely am not gonna complain about mediocre gameplay.
However, when a story-based game gives me no good story incentive, I start to think about it a lot.
And find flaws.

I do wish to write more about gameplay, but it's often the plot that I have the most to say about.

## Other reviewers

Some unfair stuff done by players and professional reviewers.

### Not a game developer

You shouldn't need to be a game developer to review games.

But if you aren't, don't tell developers how to do their jobs,
that they were lazy, or that something should have been easy to implement.
You probably aren't knowledgeable about game development enough to even begin to understand why you're wrong.

### Impatience and not meeting the game halfway

I can imagine many have been in this situation;
you show someone a game, they skip tutorials, ignore hints and/or rush,
and then complain that they don't know what to do or that they aren't winning.
Sometimes you can tell they're trying to play another game;
fighting their way through a stealth game,
or spamming attacks in a game where deliberate inputs are the way to go.

Some people just refuse to engage with a game on its terms and still expect it to be fun.
