I like torturing myself by trying to rationalize and essentialize why I didn't like certain games
as much as I expected, so having done [Bunker][bunker-link], here's the big one.

[bunker-link]: {{ site.baseurl }}/posts/bunker

Rebirth is not a bad game.
It is also not a great one, albeit it clearly has a charm to it,
since me and my friends continue to be arsed to discuss it at length time and time again
(although there's also the facts that Rebirth is made by a developer we all like and it didn't meet expectations).
It sits somewhere in that annoying range between good and flawed.
Like with many other players, Amnesia: Rebirth left me with a hollow feeling of dissatisfaction,
and out of frustration I often act like I didn't like it altogether.

Now, there's only as many adjectives I can come up with to describe the above opinion in one word,
so when I call the game "bad", don't take it at face value.

Each time I discuss this game, new arguments and annoyances seem to pop up, and ones that I agree with.
This makes figuring out why Rebirth didn't work almost a Sisyphean task,
but maybe I can get rid of rid of this curse by trying to be comprehensive about it.

Be warned that I will discuss major spoilers.

## Preface

A few things worth addressing before jumping into the flaws of the game.

### Easy pickings

Let's get some of the common criticisms out of the way first:
* Bad graphics - admittedly, Rebirth proved that FG was behind the industry when it comes to fidelity,
and by a good console generation at that. No such criticism appeared for Bunker though,
which not only didn't improve anything noticeable, but even reused many assets from Rebirth.
I think the main issue was putting FG's outdated rendering methods in full sunlight,
in the first 10 minutes of the game at that.
* Issues with level geometry - these things just happen.
Unless there is models clipping in every third room in the game,
paying attention to these is childish.
* Fear flashes are cheap jumpscares - as far as jumpscares go,
these aren't the most powerful and you learn to anticipate them.
I've seen people talk about this as if it was the single thing that "ruined the game".
It's not.

None of the above are significant factors in my opinion.
They're merely the excuses that the average gamer makes when they can't articulate why they didn't enjoy a game.
They are only surface-level flaws and focusing on them takes away from the deeper issues of the game.

### Popularity (or lack thereof) bias
The amount of talk a game generates will often dictate how many people take interest in it
and the mindset they have going in.

The pre-release period was a bit of a mess.
The advertising campaign was short and... *minimalist*, and seemingly relied on word of mouth.
Me and my friends were quite frustrated with this, especially given FG's 5 years of radio silence.
Even on the day of release, it was not uncommon to see surprised or confused people who asked if Rebirth was a remaster of TDD.

While I went into the game hopeful, this probably did give me (and others) a certain bias.
Or maybe it's testament to Rebirth's curse that this even needs to be discussed.

### The good parts

As I've mentioned, I wouldn't be writing about a game I didn't enjoy to some degree.
Here's some of the things that stood out to me:
* Rebirth explains parts about Amnesia's lore
in ways that fit incredibly well with the previous games,
sometimes to the point of retroactively explaining vague things from them.
Namely: the reasoning behind vitae, how and why TDD's monsters were created and Alexander's goals and methods.
Some say that it would be better not to demystify this lore, but I still appreciate that they did it quite well.
Although it's worth pointing out that a few quite big things don't match, mainly about Herbert's story.
* Frictional once again doesn't miss in the atmosphere department,
delivering a dense mood and great sound design.
* There is some plain cool stuff in this game,
like the design of the dark world facilities and environment
(I had quite a few "wooow' moments playing this game),
the visual and sound design of the portals, or a chase sequence featuring running in and out of the dark world.
The desert areas and Roman ruins are also well realised and cool to look at.
* The game delivers well on fanservice without being tacky.
There's the Tomb of Tin Hinan mentioned in the original game,
Herbert's expedition and Daniel's role in it being fleshed out, and
gameplay similarities like tinderboxes expanding as a mechanic by becoming matches,
or the return of loading screen lore that's about the protagonist rather than the current events.
The more observant Amnesia fans will find a lot of fun indirect references to the original here.
Which is worth appreciating, considering how experimental this game is in some regards.
* Despite various issues with the character herself,
Tasi's VA is amazing and pleasant to listen to.

## Part 1: game design

While FG's developers like to go on about how they approach their gameplay in synthesis with story,
I still find that their games don't really tell their stories through gameplay.
After all, text and audio logs are their primary vehicle for story, and these stories are usually told in retrospect.
The events we partake in are only an aftermath, an excuse to learn about the main plot, with only a few scenes progressing the actual plot.

I don't really mean that as a criticism of the game itself (or its predecessors, which do similar things),
or even mean to imply that this is necessarily a bad thing;
but it gives me an excuse to split this post into two segments, and leads into my first point.

### Flashback time

As [my favorite YT video of all time, "Thief vs. AAA Gaming"][thief] says:

> Gameplay hasn't stopped. The story hasn't stopped either though.

[thief]: https://youtu.be/jPqwDGXxLhU?si=_1YLUbq8tsUgpVwO

Rebirth is one of those games that does the opposite.
Gameplay is frequently interrupted by probably the most annoying type of story intermissions:
long audio logs that can't be played in the background.
In Rebirth it's flashbacks, which take the form of an illustration and an accompanying voiceover,
and these can last a couple of minutes.

On top of flashbacks during gameplay, the game has secondary ones during loading screens;
these are also long (longer than the actual loading time) and equally crucial to the story.
And both yank you out of gameplay.
Arguably so do notes, but with text material you can at least read at your own pace and even skim ahead.

There's also scripted dream sequences where you technically control the character,
but which still take you out of the main gameplay.
Such interruptions tend to be a bit of a nuisance,
and while expected in this type of a game, Rebirth just does this too often.

### Light and health mechanics

While I generally find the mechanics of this game a nice refreshment of the old ones,
they have many issues.

The lantern is a joke.
It runs out of fuel in what feels like the time that it takes for two matches to burn.
It is painfully clear that FG *really* wanted us to use primarily the matches,
but this level of imbalance almost feels malicious.
Perhaps they realized there was too much oil in the game and the matches
would become unimportant, but in that case they should have
reduced the amount of oil instead of tripling the fuel consumption rate.

Having the above in mind,
why the fuck are we limited to holding only 10 matches at one time?
First, this makes absolutely no logical sense - we can hold a backpack's worth of clutter in our pockets,
but no, more than 10 matches is a no-go? Come on.
Second, this limit goes against the goal of making the player rely on matches.
I understand that this is a *survival* horror game so we can't sit on a pile of resources,
but these matches are such a weak source of light and burn out so quick (running and even just moving makes them burn faster)
that the game could let you use them most of the time and it wouldn't affect the horror aspect much.

Tying to the matches is another thing;
similarly to TDD, an important gameplay mechanic (almost always missing in mods, by the way)
is lighting up candles, lamps etc.
Unlike in TDD (which has barely any pitch darkness), the game's overall light levels are very low.
There's very few areas where you can take a breather without lighting candles.
And once again unlike in TDD,
lamps give so little light that you have to hump them to stop losing sanity.
Provided you even found a lamp to light at all.

And you start to lose sanity pretty much the moment you leave a lit area.
No grace period; it becomes annoying because of how punishing it is.
This happens constantly, and annoyance is the last thing you want in a horror game
because it immediately stops the player from being scared.
So you can imagine what effect on the overall horror this has.

Not much of a problem as much as an oddity,
but there's only two heals (laudanum) in the entire game.
There were dozens of moments where I could have really used one;
the other healing mechanic, talking to Tasi's unborn baby, didn't suffice
(worth noting: the health and sanity meters are actually the same thing here).
You need to do it when the baby kicks her belly, which is highlighted with a blue visual effect.
This mechanic is explained briefly and there's a lengthy downtime afterwards,
so you never have the occassion to rehearse this.
I never got hints about it later on either, meaning I basically forgot about this for most of the game
and struggled with constantly low health.
On top of that the opportunities to heal like this aren't exactly frequent either.

Another poorly explained mechanic is the ability to lie prone that makes it easier to hide.
Like the belly thing, I either forgot about it or missed it entirely.
Unfortunately FG did not step up their tutorialisation skills,
because [Bunker][bunker-link] screwed up explaining its mechanics twice as well.

To round off the great balancing,
the fear mechanic locks your health below thresholds when it falls low enough.
Beyond these health won't regenerate when standing in light;
while this was a thing in TDD, it was once again much less punishing.
In this game, it almost ensures that once you fail you will keep failing.
As a sidenote, the fear effects sound like a mix of falling gravel and spaghetti being mixed. It's distracting.

All these things mixed together have awful effects on immersion and horror.
For me, struggling with keeping Tasi sane really distracted me from being scared.

Does this mean the game is never scary? No.
But with the exception of the masterful fort area which reaches the heights of TDD's scariness,
the game quickly loses its grip on you.

### Monster, level and encounter design

On top of the mechanics, the monster and encounter design do more to hurt the experience.

After the tease encounters in the fort, the ghouls start appearing left and right.
You get accustomed to them, which is awful considering they're not exactly terrifying in the first place.
They are an almost generic "rake" design, but they still work when kept out of sight (i.e: fort).
Unfortunately we get dozens of close encounters.
Emphasis on close; when caught, they shove their head in the camera,
further removing the sense of mystery.

Worse yet, many of the encounter arenas just don't let you avoid the enemy,
they tend to be cramped and either linear or consist of two loops at best.
Trying to get the hell out of the monster's way ends up being a challenge rather than an opportunity for being scared.
An extreme example was an end-game encounter in a corridor which only had one small side room in it.
To make things worse, the ghouls have a smell mechanic that makes them harder to hide from.
And there's no counter to it.

Need I say that getting caught is a massive nuisance in these conditions?
There's rarely an opportunity to lose the enemy and find a hiding spot in those encounter arenas.

There's also a second type of enemy that has most of the above issues,
but adds another two on top.
First, the design is just not too scary. I'm not sure why but something didn't click here.
Second, this enemy has what's effectively a ranged attack with a really long animation
that makes getting caught an even bigger nuisance.

In short, many of the monster encounters are amateur and disastruous to horror.
After a time you stop being scared of bumping into a monster
because you anticipate another annoying ordeal.
It's like replaying a horror game you already know,
except you're playing it for the first time.

### The portal mechanic

Around 30% into the game we get an amulet which allows Tasi
to use gates between worlds. These have awesome sound and visual design,
but mechanically they're not very different from scripted doors.

Having seen the amazing time travel level in Dishonored 2,
I can't help but feel this was a missed opportunity.
The portals are never used in any creative way;
there is no secret hiding spots, there is no portals that let us escape a chase,
and there is no portals which provide shortcuts across a level.
As far as I remember these are used almost exclusively as linear gateways.

While I understand that such a thing would be quite a technical feat,
I still think it's a shame this mechanic was not expanded upon.

## Part 2: story and writing

With the mechanics of how the story is told aside,
let's discuss the story itself.

### Themes vs minutia

Being a pregnant woman, alone, lost in a foreign land, and dealing with life-threatening danger
is probably the most daunting scenario you could conceive (pun intended).
Additionally Rebirth throws in loss of a previous child (and husband - although he's very quickly forgotten).
The game even has a mechanic dedicated to reminding the player that the protagonist is pregnant.
She also frequently addresses her unborn child in attempts to console herself.

And yet... this just doesn't integrate with the main events of the game.
It's not immersive, in fact it borders on distracting, and it sure does not make the game scarier.

I thought, "maybe it's just me", but no, many players struggle with this.
I don't think I've heard anyone mention being able to get into this character, even when they sympathised.

Perhaps this is because despite being far into pregnancy,
Tasi keeps running, jumping and falling in ways that would get any person hurt,
all feats rather uncharacteristic of a pregnant woman.
While she's not an ordinary person, we're supposed to believe that she is, for most of the game,
so the effect remains the same.
There's just a certain sense of detachment here that I can't fully put my finger on.

### Failing sidewards

It is amusing that Tasi falling through a floor to enter a new area is a repeated thing in this game.
Asides from being whimsical, it also makes the plot feel convenient.
Rven when the next area is a detour; because it's typically through a place of high significance anyway.
There's also a few instances of Tasi losing control and waking up in another area, which have similar effects.

These artificial segues tend to either lead Tasi closer to her goals or on big detours.
I call this "the detour story structure",
where the main character spends the majority of the story trying to get back to their original objective.
Similarly to [Prey]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts/prey), this type of plot ends up becoming a bore,
as it completely loses its momentum.

In the fort (first two hours of the game), Tasi sets out to randezvous with the expedition doctor.
Then she:
* falls into a big cistern area detour by firing a tank
* falls out of a pipe into a cistern exit
* walks about 200m to her destination
* falls through a ground portal into a massive detour in the Dark World
* teleports back but this time into an ancient tomb, where the player is tasked with making a portal to the destination
* ...but first has to complete 3 sub-areas to do it (this is where I sighed out of frustration and finished playing for the day)
* the portal ends up not working; at this point I was just dismayed

Afterwards there's several more sections where Tasi travels between worlds
and has various other misadventures, but I really can't be bothered to recall it in detail any further.
The point is, the plot has stopped dead in its tracks several hours ago
and we're just learning lore with some breadcrumbs of the backstory.
The game's story layer is only saved by the lore being interesting and some action scenes.

There's also something to be said about Tasi's falls being a part of the
"let's hurt this woman to make you sympathise with her" trope,
as popularised by Tomb Raider 2016, The Last of Us 2 and probably many movies I can't name at the moment.
It didn't work for me, asides from making me cringe (in the classic meaning of this word).

### Introductory exposition dump and cardboard cutouts

The game's intro has awful pacing.
After the first 10-ish minutes we arrive in a cave with *a lot* of writing and flashbacks to go through.
It just kills the plot's momentum right out the gate.

This is also where we learn about the cardboard cutout characters,
whose lives and demise we will be following through the story.
They're very uninteresting and the large gaps between hearing about them
mean that when we actually get to meet some of them, I couldn't really tell who it was.

I think these characters would have benefitted from more screen time
(actual screen time, not flashbacks with still images where we can't tell who is who)
and perhaps condensing some of them down into fewer characters.

I cared much more about the alien alchemist whom we read about and meet within
around 30 minutes, in one focused area, than any of the human characters that Tasi arrived with.

### Too much talk

I brushed upon this before, but would like to spell it out: Tasi talks too much.
And I don't mean this in the typically misogynist way that "gamers" say this.
I mean that it breaks the tension simply because on a meta level, it feels like someone is there accompanying you.

Additionally, the game also severely overuses the phrase "little one".
It is so pervasive that at a certain point you start rolling your eyes.
It became a staple Rebirth joke among my friends.

### Plotholes
This game has noticeable plotholes, a few big ones and probably many small ones that I don't remember.
It would take forever to discuss all of them in detail, so I'll just list some that come to mind.

* Why did Tasi travel all the way back to the plane after her ghoul transformation?
* Why does Tihana not target some other baby from the area?
* Parts of Herbert's story go entirely against his portrayal in TDD
* Why is the baby seemingly the only one that experiences accelerated aging,
and why is it only after leaving the dark world?

### The game's themes

Tasi's amnesia is more of a narrative convenience to tell a retrospective story
(i.e: we don't experience the events, we only read about them or see flashbacks of them),
rather than a core theme.
For Daniel and Mandus, the reason why they had Amnesia was the main intrigue.
Rebirth does not pose Tasi's amnesia as something to wonder about;
and funnily enough, in the end it turns out pretty much incidental.
I find it a bit disappointing that the new entries in the franchise steer away from that core motiff.

Rebirth also lacks another core theme of the previous two games;
the protagonist realizing that they were evil themselves.
As [this Tumblr post][tumblr-post] puts it:

[tumblr-post]: https://wizzard890.tumblr.com/post/633881415800520704/amnesia-rebirth-this-final-boss-is-a-lovecraftian

> Okay in the dark descent and machine for pigs the big bads are characters who have encouraged the worst instincts of the protags. Alexander's manipulations revealed the depths of daniel's craven selfishness, the machine was mandus' arrogance and distilled imperial ambitions to godhood.
>
> The Empress revealed nothing about Tasi, she wasn't set up to be a foil to her or an 'oh shit' example of what Tasi had become. Instead: Tasi is pregnant and wants to protect her child after the terrible loss of her first (a fine motivation!), but nothing that happened to Tasi is strictly her fault - the terrible things she's done haven't been the result of manipulation. Instead, she's flatly lied to over and over again and takes the only reasonable actions a person could take in that situation. She's not lying to herself about anything!

### The villain problem

Speaking of problems with the Empress.
I will again quote [the mentioned Tumblr post][tumblr-post], because it was made by a woman who explains this much better than I could.

> the pig machine could have been a 'woman' character! Alexander could have been a woman!
> Literally nothing in the writing or gameplay would have to change -- and hey presto! Fucked up and complex motivations.
> But the second Game Writing Boys have a big bad who's a woman, we have to consciously write her having woman problems like NEEDING A BABY FOR REASONS.
> What year is this gentlemen? Make your women characters deluded assholes!
> Make things their fault! Make them have endgame plans for grand philosophical evil nightmare energy. Vampire god empresses don't want to built A NURSERY


> amnesia rebirth: this final boss is a lovecraftian empress who lives eternally by siphoning off the fear and suffering of tortured humans. she wants to steal your baby!
>
> me: wow! why? is she fascinated by the humans whose torment powers her? is she lonely, living forever in a post-apocalyptic hellscape? is she greedy for some other life? is it for her own inscrutable eldritch reasons?
>
> amnesia rebirth: :)))
>
> me: ......oh no
>
> amnesia rebirth: see, because she's an empress-
>
> me: don't do this
>
> amnesia rebirth: which means she's a woman-
>
> me: please no
>
> amnesia rebirth: but get this, she's infertile-
>
> me: jesus
>
> amnesia rebirth: so she wants your baby!
>
> me: but WHY
>
> amnesia rebirth: because she's... a woman who doesn't have one, what about this isn't computing for you?

### Title expectations

The subtitle "Rebirth" led to a letdown for me.
Did Alexander do something crazy to get resurrected?
Or maybe the Empress wants to possess Tasi's baby to break free from her incapacitated body?

No. It's just a baby. Why is the game called Rebirth then?
Because Tasi gets her daughter back? She doesn't, it's a new child,
conceived entirely normally. Calling it a rebirth would be a very weird way of thinking about kids.

Is it because Tasi goes through a daunting ordeal to come out a different person?
No, not really... Tasi doesn't change as a character.
Is it because she becomes a ghoul?

I just don't see the relevance of this title. The game might as well be called "Birth".

## Part 3: The exceptional highlights

// these 2 parts kinda save the game
// one where mechanics and scares are properly utilized
// and one where the mechanics are set aside to let you focus on intrigue and wonder, like in soma

### The Fort
// an example of how good this game could have been
// bunker recons back to it?

### Dark world facilities

// only the parts without monsters
// match and light mechanics are not present
// reminds of soma a bit

The times when we visit the Dark World facilities
and don't have to avoid monsters are another case of FG magic shining through.
With the annoying light-related survival elements temporarily removed,
we are allowed to wander around these truly places and learn about them,
entirely free to feel how alien and deserted they are, ponder their culture,
interact with the mysterious machinery, and be amazed at all of it.
These parts heavily remind me of SOMA, in the best possible ways.

## Conclusions

Perhaps it has become apparent to you, dear reader,
that this article/review has been even more disjointed than my usual writing.
I'm bringing this up because it is a microcosm of Rebirth's quality and the discourse surrounding it.

There are a lot of issues, but no single thing "ruins" the game.
It's both everything and nothing in particular; a death by a thousand cuts.

Amnesia: Rebirth is a game which took risks and lost.
Its high-level ideas and themes were terrifying on paper, but fell flat in execution.
It innovated upon *The Dark Descend*'s mechanics, but fails to balance them so hard that they become distracting.
It is a testament to this that some of the coolest areas of the game are where these mechanics are *not* in play.
Entirely new mechanics were mostly underwhelming.
Rebirth's level design was safely linear, to the point of seeming amateurish.
Its writing is scattered, characters uninteresting, and the game's pace frequently grinds to a halt, both on a small scale and on the large one.
All wrapped in a compellingly executed graphical and sonic package,
with certain care and attention paid to its predecessor that makes it hard to dismiss altogether.

And there it is, the most cursed game I have ever reviewed. Here's to hoping it stays this way.

---

## Addendum: the aftermath

While this does not really mean much for the game itself,
there are several topics pertaining to Rebirth's reception that I think are worth discussing,
because they have a tendency to sour the game further for some people.
Including me, to a degree.

### Sales

Quality and success (financial or perceived by the amount of talk) are often treated inseparably.
It's very easy to get biased like this.
Quite interestingly though, people can justify their opinion on a game in any combination of these two factors:
* It's good so it sold well
* It's bad so it sold badly (we're here)
* It's good but sold badly because the audience is dumb
* It's bad but sold well because the audience is dumb

[As FG eventually admitted][5m-later],
the game did not break even 5 months after release,
and as far as we know it might still be a net loss for the studio.

[5m-later]: https://frictionalgames.com/2021-03-amnesia-rebirth-five-months-later-and-soma-sells-1m-copies/

I wish I wasn't susceptible to such biases,
but me and my friends undoubtedly saw this as a confirmation of our unfavorable opinions on the game.
Is that a bad thing? I don't know anymore.
However, it is either an indicator of Rebirth being flawed or the marketing being done poorly,
and I wanted to find out which.

FG makes claims of topping the Steam bestsellers, and matching SOMA's "sales course".
Google's search interest seems to confirm that.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/misc/rebirth_search_interest.png){:.centered}

[The Steam player counts][steam-charts]
paint a more complicated picture though.
While Rebirth peaked higher than SOMA, it seems to have much worse sustained player counts.
In other words, SOMA's and TDD's long-term reputations still draw in new players years after release,
and Rebirth much less so.

A slightly higher percentage of players actually finished Rebirth than SOMA (34.6% vs 31.4%,
Steam achievement for finishing the game), but due to how Steam counts this,
it is not an indicator of better sales or higher interest; only the raw number of finished games would paint such a picture.

[steam-charts]: https://steamdb.info/charts/?compare=57300,282140,999220,1944430&release

Interestingly, Bunker had even more search interest than Rebirth, by an almost 45% margin at that, but had an over twice lower player count on release.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/misc/rebirth_steam_players.png){:.centered}

Regardless, [by FG's own admission][5m-later] the game didn't do too well financially and sales-wise:
Rebirth sold 100k copies in 5 months whereas [SOMA sold 92k in 10 days][soma-blog],
and in 6 months SOMA sold 250k.

### Blaming the audience
